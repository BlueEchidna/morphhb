Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible
	5/3/2014

The Open Scripures Hebrew Bible is a project to analyze the Hebrew Bible 
by lemma and morphology. The project is marked up in OSIS XML and currently 
contains lemma attributes for most words (using an augmentation of Strong's
numbers). We are in the process of adding morphology attributes as well.

Miqra according to the Mesorah

We have added a new text of the Hebrew Bible, based on the Aleppo Codex,
under MAPM.
