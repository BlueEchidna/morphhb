Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible

The Open Scripures Hebrew Bible is a project to analyze the Hebrew Bible 
by lemma and morphology. The project is marked up in OSIS XML and currently 
contains lemma attributes for most words (using Strong's numbers). Soon we 
plan to begin adding morphology attributes as well.
