Cantillation Structure

I am proposing a markup solution for recording cantillation structure
in the OpenScriptures Hebrew Bible.  This unobtrusively adds form
attributes to words containing disjunctive accents.  The application
OshbVerse is a proof of concept, that takes selected chapters and
displays them verse-by-verse in the structured form.  It is meant to
demonstrate the effective use of the structure attributes.  At
present, it is capable of showing only Genesis chapers 1, 8 and 32,
and Psalm 1.  Any other choice defaults to Genesis 1.  This covers
examples of the basic structure, as well as ketiv/qere handling in
Genesis 8, alternate versification notes in Genesis 32, and poetic
structure in Psalm 1.

Should the proposal prove acceptable, structure attributes will be
added throughout the OSHB text.  A full application can then be
developed from there.
